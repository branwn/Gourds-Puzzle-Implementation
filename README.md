# Implementation of Gourds Puzzle and Automatic Solving Algorithms
- Used Pygame to complete the Gourds Puzzle game and implement two automated algorithms; 
- The code implemented the automatic search algorithm of Hamiltonian Cycles in Triangular Grids; 
- The code implemented the puzzle algorithm with O(n^3) and O(n^2) complexity; proposed a new algorithm that is better than the one described in the article.
